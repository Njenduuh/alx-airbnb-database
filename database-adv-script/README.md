## üîç Queries Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN ‚Äî Bookings + Users

Returns bookings **only when** a user is linked to it.

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.guest_id = u.user_id;
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN ‚Äî Properties + Reviews

Returns **all properties**, even those without reviews. Review columns are `NULL` if no match.

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN ‚Äî Users + Bookings

Returns **all users** and **all bookings**, even if not connected.  
MySQL doesn‚Äôt support `FULL OUTER JOIN` natively, so we use a `UNION`:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM User u
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.guest_id

UNION

SELECT ...
FROM Booking b
LEFT JOIN User u ON b.guest_id = u.user_id;
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Run

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p airbnb_db < joins_queries.sql
```

You can also copy/paste each query into MySQL Workbench or any database client.
